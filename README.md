## About

This full-day workshop is designed for ROS 2 developers ready to dive into aerial robotics with PX4. You’ll connect ROS 2 nodes to PX4’s real-time flight stack, stream telemetry into RViz, build offboard control logic, and integrate perception using Gazebo, ArUco markers, and LiDAR. By the end, you’ll have a complete simulation environment, reusable code, and a path to real hardware—no prior PX4 knowledge required.

This repository contains all the materials for the ROSCon 2025 PX4 + ROS 2 Workshop.

## Outline

### Introduction & Drone Architecture

### Environment Setup

How to set up the simulation and development environment in Docker.

Please go to [docs/setup.md](./docs/setup.md).

### Control Pipelines

The first set of exercises will cover how to control a PX4 drone through ROS 2

#### Offboard Demo

Offboard control leverage the PX4 Offboard control mode.

Please go to [px4_roscon_25/offboard_demo/README.md](./px4_roscon_25/offboard_demo/README.md).

#### Custom Mode Demo

Custom external modes are a newer interface that offers greater flexibility and control.

Please go to [px4_roscon_25/custom_mode_demo/README.md](./px4_roscon_25/custom_mode_demo/README.md).

### Perception & Application

#### Precision Land

#### Run the simulation environment

### External Resources
